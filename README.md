# Simple-Perceptron
This is a simple neural networks simulation. The perceptron is a single layer feed-forward neural network. 

## Artificial Neural Network

Information processing architecture loosely modeled on the brain.
Consist of large number of interconnected processing units (neurons)
Work in parallel to accomplish a global task
Generally used to model relations between inputs and outputs or find patterns in data.
3 types of layers (Input layer, Hidden layer, Output layer)
